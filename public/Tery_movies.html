        <h3>Harry Potter (all of them!)</h3>
        <p>The Harry Potter franchise has been a    huge part of my childhood and rewatching   the movies and reading the books is   always a favorite pastime of mine.
        </p>

        <h3>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find  Them</h3>
        <p>These movies provide an interesting  spin on the Wizarding World and tell a   fascinating story about one of    Voldemort's predecessors, Gellert  Grindelwald.
        </p>

        <h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3>
        <p>These movies have it all. Action     packed scenes are frequently broken up by   moments of comic relief and unexpected    emotional depth.
